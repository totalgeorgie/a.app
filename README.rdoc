== Stuff to think about on backbone
Answer the question that makes you look best

Right now, because we are serving assets and json on the same controller action, we are basically hitting the database twice for no reason... perhaps move the json to a different namespace or leave the controller before it all happens. 

On Profile, make way to bootstrap in city, position data, etc. Go through each and get the selected one

--here's what we believe: foreigners who speak chinese are an underrated asset in the marketplace and can do the kinds of things that companies look for in the modern globalized economy. working with companies from china and the west in all different industries, we bust our ass to get people into awesome jobs that set them up for success with their language skills. 
[2014-01-09 9:35:21 PM] Abraham Sorock: 2. why you should create a profile / what it should say / how it helps
[2014-01-09 9:35:25 PM] Abraham Sorock: 3. why you should create a video / how it helps.

[2014-01-09 9:36:55 PM] Abraham Sorock: ->While going over our current process, if you have ideas to why a user is not doing x, let's write that in, and make sure it's addressed in the app

------
i am not comfortable making a video 
i don't know what the video should say 
i am not confident in my chinese 
i'm not looking for a job yet or that actively, so i don't want to spend a lot of time signing up 
i don't see any jobs i like 
i don't have or want to take the time to fill out a profile 
i don't feel the need to share any information besides a resume 
i don't really understand how this process works, so let me just leave my email here

[2014-01-09 9:44:57 PM] Abraham Sorock: ok so what i was saying anyway
[2014-01-09 9:45:19 PM] Abraham Sorock: have the tutorials sent to people as drip emails
[2014-01-09 9:45:29 PM] Abraham Sorock: but also have them online on the back end to get people to write what we need
        --So on front-end, also have testimonials, couple of key things on good application etc, that'll let us know. 

[2014-01-09 9:45:56 PM] Abraham Sorock: and then if its apparent that someone has already gone through and done the whole application, we can just skip to the job tips email

[2014-03-25 6:40:34 PM] Abraham Sorock: THEN, search function that is able to find key words and key conditions / tags in database to auto-populate short list.
[2014-03-25 6:40:39 PM] Abraham Sorock: if we have THAT, that is the key function.
[2014-03-25 6:41:11 PM] Abraham Sorock: the other cool thing would be do generate cool looking candidate profiles, the way we just talked about, with an embedded video and some text information, maybe on a file or maybe on a unique web link.
