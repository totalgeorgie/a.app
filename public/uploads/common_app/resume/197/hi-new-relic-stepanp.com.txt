Hi New Relic Team. 

You're building one of the coolest products that are core to eveyone's dev stack. You help developers sleep better at night, and I'd love to be a part of it!

You got me excited about this position after you said 'influence the business side'. Finally! That's awesome, that's where I'd like to provide most growth, and I know it'll be an excellent experience to learn with you.

For the last 2 years, I've been in Asia consulting in Rails with Derek Sivers and Sebastian Marshall, and just arrived in the SF to dive in with a team focused on growth. 

Would you be up to meet up to chat for about 15 minutes? I'm in SF right now, and I'm stoked to check out what you're are up to, share some ideas, and and see if there's a fit. 


Cheers, Stepan
